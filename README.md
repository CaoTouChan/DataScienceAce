# DataScienceAce
This repository covers various aspects of a data science project, including exploratory data analysis, data processing, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, training, and validation.

# Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Follow the instructions below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaoTouChan/DataScienceAce.git
cd DataScienceAce
```

2. Create a virtual environment using the command below:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

This repository is structured to guide you through various stages of a data science project:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform exploratory data analysis.
* **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**: Utilize the modules in the src/ directory to clean, preprocess, and engineer features from your data.
* **Model Building and Validation**: Build, train, and validate your models using functions provided in the src/ directory.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize your model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters. 

For specific examples and usage, please refer to the documentation within each module and notebook.

# Getting Started

To get started:

* Explore the raw data in the `data/raw/` directory.
* Follow the exploratory analysis notebook in `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`.
* Preprocess the data and engineer features using functions from `src/data_processing.py` and `src/feature_engineering.py`.
* Build and train your model using `src/model_building.py`.
* Validate your model's performance with `src/validation.py`.
* Optimize the hyperparameters using `src/hyperparameter_tuning.py`.
